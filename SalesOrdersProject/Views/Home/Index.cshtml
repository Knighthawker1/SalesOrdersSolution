            This online store was made with the experienced mountain-biker in mind. While there are some items that
            are marketed towards beginners, most of our products are designed for people who have spent a long time
            biking, and are fully invested in their hobby.

            Unpacked snow and mud throughout. Jewel of the Amasa Back area, relatively new to the other
            trails. Technical singletrack in the Southside Hills above Kilbride. The trails all run
            parallel to the Fountain Place paved road so they can be shuttled by car. Just a few very small
            snow patches left on the connector to 38 Special.

            The climb to the top ends with a beautiful vista of Twin Lakes and the surrounding area.
            Narrow in places and twisty througout, this leg churner is sure to keep you on you toes.
            Riders need to be at a decent skill level to attempt this trail. Out here you will find the
            most legal features including log rides, jumps and rock rolls in South Tahoe including the new
            jumps, berms, rollers and hips TAMBA and SBTS built in 2014. It doesn't get much use though
            so is sometimes a bit overgrown.
